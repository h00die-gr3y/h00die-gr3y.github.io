This site explores the wonderfull world of hacking targeting specific use cases that are sometimes not easy to understand 
and are not well documented. Most of the stuff here has been a result from my experience as hacker and the learning curve
that I had to travel to make things work.

The intent is to contribute and provide education/learning to the novice hacker community in the early stages of their development.
For the old gang, most of the stuff here is bread & butter however you might find new things here and there that might be of your interest.

Good Luck !
