title:  "GeoServer Metasploit exploit module"
---
Recently [CVE-2024-36401](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36401) was announced that describes a vulnerability in GeoServer.
GeoServer is an open-source software server written in Java that provides the ability to view, edit, and share geospatial data.
It is designed to be a flexible, efficient solution for distributing geospatial data from a variety of sources such as Geographic Information System (GIS) databases, web-based data, and personal datasets.
 
Multiple OGC request parameters allow Remote Code Execution (RCE) by unauthenticated users through specially crafted input against a default GeoServer installation due to unsafely evaluating property names as `XPath` expressions.

Affected versions:
> `>= 2.24.0, < 2.24.4` <br />
> `>= 2.25.0, < 2.25.2` <br />
> `< 2.23.6` <br />

I created a Metaspoit module `exploit/multi/http/geoserver_unauth_rce_cve_2024_36401`{: style="color: lime"} that has been released in main stream of Metasploit.<br />
