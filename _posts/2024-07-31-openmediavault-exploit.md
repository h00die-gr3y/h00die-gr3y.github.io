title:  "OpenMediaVault Metasploit exploit module"
---
This is a new module addressing an old vulnerability in OpenMediaVault, an open-source NAS solution.
The vulnerability exists within all OpenMediaVault versions starting from `0.1` until the recent release `7.4.2-2` and it allows an authenticated user to create cron jobs as root on the system.
An attacker can abuse this by sending a POST request via rpc.php to schedule and execute a cron entry that runs arbitrary commands as root on the system.
I created a Metaspoit module `unix/webapp/openmediavault_auth_cron_rce`{: style="color: lime"} that has been released in main stream of Metasploit.<br />

Annoucement will follow shortly.
