title:  "How to spawn an UART shell?"
---
Hacking IoT hardware to find exploits is fun but can be challenging if you do not have access to the Firmware.<br />
Using Firmware emulation allows you to gain access to the firmware without having the hardware in hand.
But if you have access to the IoT hardware, the other way to gain access is to detect and spawn an UART shell.<br />
In my article [Spawning UART shells](/iot-uart-shell/ "Spawning UART shells"), I explain how to do this using a Flipper Zero.

Happy reading!
